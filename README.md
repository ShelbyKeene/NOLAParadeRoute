####Roadmap of Future Improvements:

My future plans for updating this map based website include incorporating parade routes for all carnival crews throughout the entire Mardi Gras season, and also adding an option for users to view parade routes for other holidays in New Orleans, such as St. Patrick's Day parades. I aim to provide a resource for parade-goers to easily access information on all holiday parades in the city.
